				I've easily me thousands of people in my life and none of them have changed the way I see the world as much as you. Yes that includes Alp and Michele. You've made me feel like the king of the(Our) world and unstoppable when I am with you. When that Minerva incident happened I took it like a champ and I am sure it was because you were there. And I felt the lowerst without you, after you left I started to really feel the impact of Minervas rejection and what it meant to be in a long distance relationship. Even though I felt like a sad puppy, for a while, you were  the reason for me to keep improving, because I knew you loved me and wanted me to be happy. So I got over it much faster than I would have alone. You make me better, you are the guacomoli to my plain piece of bread and our relationship is the cherry tomatoes. I love you Franziska and promise to do my best at taking care of you and myself so that way i become not just an ordinary plain bread, but a nice tasty and sexy golden toast. A puppy into a great german shepard. Cheesy as it is, you are one of the best things that has happened to me in my life and I will fight to keep you in it, even tibbers.
