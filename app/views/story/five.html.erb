	<h3 class="text">After you left, I felt empty again, but this time it wasn't as bad. It was the Minerva thing that really stung. Luckily, Damien showed up soon after and distracted me for a bit. Then there was that time when I thought I was gonna lose you, since the long distance was taking a toll on you. WHen you told me that I was actually terrified and hollow, I didn't want to imagine life without you in it. But luckily we got through it and how things are starting to get better. After that, I was determined to be more consious with our relationship, just so I can make you happy, which then makes me happy ;). So thats when I decieded to make this website. I knew our anniversary was coming up and so was your birthday, I really wished I could've spend it beside, but since I couldn't, I thought this was the next best thing. Remember when I asked for the pictures and music all sneaky like? Yeah it was all for this, also this was the secret project hinted a few times, but you had to ask, so I had to lie a little. Sorry not sorry. But I hope you like it, as the years go by I plan on adding more and improving the site, just as we improve. I love you babygirl, no matter what. You are the first and last thing I wake up to and if I could choose between my cats and you, I'd pick you. But preferable both, since you are also my kitty.</h3>
