	<h3 class="text">So this was the time where life was at its lowest. I remember not doing anything remotely productive for weeks. I woke up late and told myself it was jetlag and smoked my heart out and said it was just a phase of nostalgia. By now I am pretty sure it was some temporary depression or something else. I felt tired and awful all day. I remember that it should've been my happiest moments, I mean after all, I had a beautiful girl friend who was gonna come and visit and an old friend from Hong Kong for fishing, also I was going to Minerva, a dream school for most. As much as I want to be a strong puppy, puppies have hearts of gold, a soft metal. Losing my friends and you and my daily routine was devestating, and I was left without much purpose and full of regerets. My only comfort was the messages I'd get from you throught the day and that would leave me grining for a while. I remember how I keep thinking about you and how you were gonna visit as a motivation to slowly improve, started telling you about gym and how i wanted to quit smoking, soon after I actually did it and was so happy. You may not have known it. But you were my wall during that time, the little joy of sunshine in my stormy mind. And like your puns they were contagious wether I wanted them or not the sunshine spread and started to make me happier and better. I can only hope that I can become that wall for you too.</h3>
