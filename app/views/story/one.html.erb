	<h3 class="text">I remember overloading of feelings that day. I guess you could say i felt too much, and it was hella confusing. I was relieved that I was done with IB, all that waking up early, sleeping late, skipping lunch for gas station chips and coffee in the cafe. I was proud to have said I survived the IB and that I graduated in UWC Mostar, but most of all I was proud I made it through all that shit and still was able to maintain a relationship with you. I was anxious and sad, since it reminded me of the inevitable seperation from my old Mostarian life. No longering being able to wake up next to you grumpily eating a sandwich, which you had brought from the canteen for me, no longer going to the cafe and chainsmoking with Alp and Michele while we studied or messed aroud with stupid stuff. It still makes me sad and nostalgic thinking about it now. One of the things I regret from that time was the fight we had at the party at hostel Bristole, I can't even remember what the fight was about, all I know is I should've been more conscious of the situation and about how you felt. I know for a fact that if i was more conscious even for a few minutes, we could've had a much better time and a more happy and wholesome memory from it. Nevertheless, I did gain a new appreciation for you from that, I may not remember what the fight was about, but i remmeber how it felt and how sad you were, but in the end we still stayed beside eachother, no matter how difficult it got, we were still there for eachother. Even though sometimes to be there to be grumpy at the other person, we were still there for eachother. And that is one of the memories I keep remembering to kinder my confidence in having a long distance relationship.</h3>
