	<h1 class="text">Leaving</h1>
	<h3 class="text">I remember standing up and looking out the window for you, and then you came back on the bus and I think you brought me some snacks. I don't remeber why you did it, but I remember that you did, and it filled me with happiness and sadness. I told myself, "Yup that definetly is the girl of you dreams, try to be happy so she will have a happy memory to take with her." I was empty inside when you left, I keep trying to distract myself with music or audiobooks, but I kept thinking about you on my bus back. I remember thinking if there was a way to get you to follow me on the bus to the airport just so I could spend a few more moments with you. I know how you don't like me not sharing all my thoughts all the time, but I'm working on it. Plus pride doesn't like the idea of looking weak infront of my babygirl. Honestly, now that I'm writing this a few months later, I can safely say that leaving on that bus hurt more than the Minerva betrayal. After a few weeks I stopped caring about Minerva, even now thinking about that bus ride leaving me a bit worse for wear mentally. I was leaving such a messed up and beautiful(like you) place. I remember also regretting working for the last few days instead of just spending it with you. Some part of me tried to distance myself from not only you but also the other guys. I think it was just my subconsious trying to distance myself before the impact so it would hurt less. Trust me it didn't help, if anything it made it worst. Even later on I still did that when you came and visited me, but luckily I was starting to realise it and managed to save a few days before we were sepearated again. When I visit you in the winter, I will make sure not to make the same mistake again. And I am sorry for doing that before. Now I bet in your mind you are probably thinking like, Oh i told you so. Well shush you. Sometimes, very rarely, I can be wrong ;p. Leaving was painful, but I think it may end up working better for our relationship rather than for worse, and I can't wait to see how indestructible and mature our relationship will turn out.</h3>
